# Student Dropout Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of student dropout using a combination of demographic, academic, and socioeconomic factors. The objective is to assist educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early and taking proactive interventions.

## Project Overview

- Used a cleaned dataset covering multiple student attributes
- Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing
- I contributed primarily to **data cleaning**, **reporting**, and **model review**
- The final model was interpreted using SHAP to explain feature importance

This was a collaborative academic project for our Predictive Data Analytics course.

## Files Included

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, and model building
- `data.csv`: Dataset used for training the model
